* Thoughts on saving file info ...

right now, we populate file info based on System.IO.Directory.GetFiles()
=return files.Select(s => new ContentModel {Name = Path.GetFileName(s), ContentType = ContentType.File, });=
we can try something like ...
+ add a property to ContentModel: IsDeleted
+ When we run GetFiles (an extension method!), we can filter out anything that has previously been set to IsDeleted
we can put a json file in a configured folder
that file can have one entry for each file

** write the json
we can update the json whenever we do a put or delete
we probably need a different model especially for the json
#+BEGIN_SRC 
class ContentPersistenceModel
  class FileModel
     string Name
     bool IsDeleted
  class FolderModel
    string Name
    List<FileModel> Files
  List<FolderModel> Folders
#+END_SRC
names of folders and files should be unique
it would be good if we could get rid of the doubling up of path separators ...
